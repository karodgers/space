A: Yes, the interface is responsive and works on tablets and smartphones, though some features are optimized for larger screens.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: The system uses client-side processing only. No sensitive data is transmitted or stored externally.

### Fabrication Questions

**Q: What happens if fabrication fails?**
A: Materials are not consumed if fabrication fails. The system will indicate the error and allow retry.

**Q: Can I queue multiple fabrications?**
A: Currently, only one fabrication can run at a time. Queue multiple items for sequential processing.

### Recovery Questions

**Q: What determines if waste can be recovered?**
A: Recovery potential is based on material type, condition, and processing capabilities.

**Q: How is recovery efficiency calculated?**
A: Efficiency is the percentage of input waste successfully converted to reusable materials.

### Inventory Questions

**Q: How are minimum thresholds determined?**
A: Thresholds are set based on consumption rates and safety margins for continuous operation.

**Q: What happens when inventory is low?**
A: The system displays alerts and prevents fabrication requiring insufficient materials.
