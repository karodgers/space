## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Space Waste Management System, please help us by reporting it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:
- **security@swms-project.org**

You can expect:
- A response within 48 hours acknowledging receipt of your report
- Regular updates on our progress investigating and fixing the issue
- Notification when the issue is resolved

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact and severity assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Our Commitment

We commit to:
- Investigating all legitimate reports
- Keeping you informed about our progress
- Not disclosing your identity without permission
- Treating your report with confidentiality
- Acknowledging your contribution to security

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security

The Space Waste Management System operates primarily as a client-side web application with the following security measures:

- **No sensitive data storage**: All data is stored locally in the browser
- **Input validation**: All user inputs are validated client-side
- **XSS prevention**: React's built-in XSS protection mechanisms
- **Content Security Policy**: Restrictive CSP headers (recommended for deployment)

### Data Handling

- **Local storage only**: No server-side data persistence
- **No authentication**: Currently no user authentication system
- **Session management**: Browser-based session handling
- **Data encryption**: Local data is not encrypted (client-side only)

### Network Security

- **HTTPS requirement**: All deployments should use HTTPS
- **No external APIs**: Currently no external service integrations
- **CDN security**: Content delivery networks should be configured securely

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Client-side data storage**: Sensitive operational data should not be stored locally
2. **No authentication**: Multi-user scenarios require authentication implementation
3. **Network communications**: Future API integrations need secure communication protocols

### Future Security Enhancements

- User authentication and authorization
- Encrypted data storage
- Secure API communications
- Audit logging
- Access control mechanisms

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Deployment Security

- Always deploy over HTTPS
- Use secure hosting providers
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Regular security updates
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### Operational Security

- Limit access to authorized personnel only
- Use secure networks for system access
- Regular backup of critical data
- Monitor system logs for anomalies
- Implement incident response procedures

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as soon as possible after verification
- Documented in the changelog
- Communicated through project channels
- Tagged with appropriate severity levels
